# URL shortening service

## Description
A URL Shortener is a service that takes a long URL and generates a shorter, unique alias that redirects users to the original URL. This alias is often a fixed-length string of characters. The system should be able to handle millions of URLs, allowing users to create, store, and retrieve shortened URLs efficiently. Each shortened URL needs to be unique and persistent. Additionally, the service should be able to handle high traffic, with shortened URLs redirecting to the original links in near real-time. In some cases, the service may include analytics to track link usage, such as click counts and user locations.

## Usage:
- Send a POST request with a long `url` using Curl
```
   curl -vL -XPOST http://localhost:8080/ \
         -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
         -d "long_url=https://www.google.com"
```
